	<h1 class="essaytitle">Why You Should Get Involved in the Miniature Wargame Hobby</h1>
	
	<h4 class="published">Published on November 4, 2022</h4>
	
	<h4 class="noteonessay"> <p>A note about this essay:</p><p>This essay was composed as a researched argument for the Advanced Writing & Research (English 301) course at BYU–I. Per assignment parameters, the audience this essay was written for was the course professor, hence the references to both the professor and advocating for him and his family to get involved in the miniature wargame hobby.</p></h4>

		<p>Whenever I have a free Saturday, there is nothing I love more than cracking open some paint pots, grabbing some brushes, and intricately layering some paint on plastic miniatures. These tiny figurines, only around one inch tall, are challenging to paint. But the results are so rewarding. With a completed miniature you can be the coolest member of your Dungeons & Dragons party, or you could paint a few more and put together some highly detailed dioramas of historical or fantasy settings, or you could paint a lot more and craft the ultimate wargaming army. Just over a year ago I started to get involved in the miniature wargame (MWG) hobby when I picked up my first book and starter set for Warhammer 40,000 (often referred to as “40k”) published by Games Workshop (GW), a game of epic battles fought in the “grimdark” future of the 41st millennium. </p>
		
		<p>The core rulebook for the game sets a dramatic scene, where, “[a]cross the vast and fragmented Imperium of Mankind, in every star system and on every front the fires of war burn” (Warhammer Studio, 2020). Sci-fi isn’t your preference? With other GW publications like the fantasy settings of Warhammer Age of Sigmar and the Middle-Earth Strategy Battle Game, to the wild and wacky fantasy football of Blood Bowl, to dozens of non-GW products set in various fantasy, sci-fi, or historical settings, there is something for everyone—and these games bring people together in positive ways. Professor Stewart, you and your children should get involved in the MWG hobby because it facilitates creative expression, allows and rewards expression of various personality types, and helps individuals cope with the emotional difficulties of life.</p>
	
		<p class="essayheading">Creative Expression</p>
	
		<p>The setting of 40k sounds pretty bleak, but that doesn’t mean that your paint jobs have to be! As a young child I was always drawing, sculpting, or painting—I even attended an art school once a week in the 5th grade. But as I grew older and focused more on music and then technical drafting skills, I lost a lot of interest in the visual arts. When I decided to jump into 40k last summer, it was like a creative spark was ignited again: I felt so much joy and felt like a deep part of me was being shared with the world again. Storytelling is another aspect of creative expression as well. Finnish researchers Mikko Meriläinen, Jaakko Stenros, and Katriina Heljakka published a research article in the journal Simulation & Gaming in 2020 that explores multiple aspects of creative expression in wargaming:</p>
		
		<p class="essayblockquote">There is a fair bit of imaginative play and daydreaming happening around miniaturing, for example in planning how to physically craft a miniature. However, this play of the imagination is most obvious in the creative creation of life stories for miniatures. (2020)</p>
		
		<p>Your miniatures can craft epic stories of heroism or tragedy, through both their paint jobs and the stories you create for them. It can be an excellent way to involve children in creative storytelling.</p>

		<p class="essayheading">Expression and Rewarding of Various Personality Types</p>
		
		<p>Professor Stewart, do you and all of your children share the same personality type? Probably not, and it can be challenging to find activities that everyone in the group enjoys. One of the great things about miniature wargaming is that because of how many different aspects of the hobby there are, it can meet the needs of very different people. Little research has been conducted in nearly forty years since the first edition of Warhammer: The Mass Combat Fantasy Role-Playing Game was published in 1983. This prompted psychology researchers at German universities to survey players to discover if there was a singular trait that wargamers shared that drew them to these games. They discovered that:</p>
		
		<p class="essayblockquote">Results showed several significant associations between personality and motivations for engaging in these games. People who played MWGs to socialize were high in openness and extraversion. Players high in agreeableness did not want to compete and did not emphasize winning as an important factor. People who played to escape from everyday problems reported high levels of neuroticism. Story-driven gamers described themselves as open and agreeable. Clearly, personality is relevant for predicting the attractiveness of MWGs, and the game has different aspects of attractiveness for different groups. (Körner & Schütz, 2021)</p>
		
		<p>There is something for everyone in wargaming. I hobby for the craft, for the lore, and for the ridiculous and funny things that can happen during games. Which of Körner and Schützs’ categories are you most drawn to?</p>
		
		<p class="essayheading">Coping With Emotional Difficulty</p>
		
		<p>It is no surprise to anyone that virtually all people were negatively affected emotionally during the COVID-19 pandemic. Being stuck indoors and away from work and school, it was taxing on everyone, especially families. During this time, the sales of GW products soared (with myself as a new contributor). In an article by Heather Burman, published by the BBC, several stories are shared of different individuals using MWGs to cope with the difficulties of lockdown. One of the stories she shares is about Gareth Beverly, for whom, “[t]abletop gaming - a resurrection of Gareth's teenage hobby - became a way of the family spending quality time together during the pandemic.” He modified some elements of the game to make it more accessible for his young children; and he reaped personal benefits as well, stating that “I get to be creative” (Burman, 2021). Quality family time is an important thing, and in a world with an unstable Eastern Europe, we do not know when our next COVID-like hardship will come.</p>
		
		<p class="essayheading">Conclusion</p>
		
		<p>There are lots of hobbies and activities out there that appeal to a wide variety of people, but none facilitate creative expression through a combination of crafting, storytelling, and strategy gaming. It appeals to multiple types of people, and has shown to be an effective coping mechanism during times of unprecedented world disaster. Will you join me in taking up the call to arms in the 41st millennium?</p>
