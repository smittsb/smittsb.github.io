		<p>I have probably spent way too much time playing video games. Or maybe I haven’t spent enough time? My game backlog on Steam is sitting there, taunting me. Games like Fallout 4 and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild eagerly await my unlocking of every location and completion of every quest. It’s been a while since I’ve been able to sit down and really play a video game, besides some occasional Mario Kart with my roommates—but I understand the concern of gaming’s effects on students, with how intentionally addictive they are. Writer Jason Pargin feels the same way, having composed the article “5 Creepy Ways Video Games Are Trying to Get You Addicted.” In his article, Pargin creates a very persuasive argument for how addictive video games are by citing a source from an industry researcher and their personal confessional, utilizing effective and relatable figures of speech, and by employing “bathos” and varying levels of diction to keep his readers engaged.</p>
	
		<p class="essayheading">Source from a Researcher and Insider</p>
	
		<p>Those who study video game usage and gamers have determined that it is possible to become addicted to video games, the same way one can become addicted to gambling or narcotics. The issue is convincing gamers that video game addiction is real. Most addictions have glaring and obvious signs, such as the physical and mental impact of alcoholism and nicotine addiction, or the financial burdens of gambling addictions. Video games do not typically have the same level of clearly visible negative impact, so it can be harder to recognize how damaging they can be. Pargin quotes an article written by John Hopson, who conducts research about video games for Microsoft, who says, “Each contingency is an arrangement of time, activity, and reward, and there are an infinite number of ways these elements can be combined to produce the pattern of activity you want from your players." As Pargin himself describes the issue, this is disturbing. By including a source that says that designers specifically craft games in ways to control your behavior in-game, Pargin builds the credibility of his argument. Oftentimes, there is no source more credible, or damning, than an insider’s confession.</p>

		<p class="essayheading">Relatable Figures of Speech</p>
		
		<p>Everyone loves a good metaphor to describe something, and Pargin knows how to use them to both hook his audience and make his argument more convincing. Another piece of Hopson’s research that Pargin shares is the concept of a Skinner Box, “a cage containing a small animal that, for instance, presses a lever to get food pellets.” Hopson’s research implies that we, the gamers, are nothing more than metaphorical rats in a box trying to meet our needs. Pargin also notes that game design has changed from a singular product purchase to a subscription model, in which you have to continuously pay to play. He frequently references World of Warcraft throughout his article, which is the perfect example of the pay-to-play Skinner Box. It costs the user (rat) around $15 per month (pushing the lever) to play the game (receive the food pellets). Even the game itself is built around making the player run around, pushing all of the levers, to get that sweet serotonin.</p>
		
		<p>Another simile that Pargin employs is the inverse of what are known as “massively multiplayer online role-playing games” (MMORPG) like World of Warcraft:</p>
		
		<p class="essayblockquote">[W]here you make the levels really short so it's like eating potato chips. They're so small on their own that it doesn't take much convincing to get the player to grab another one, and soon they've eaten the whole bag.</p>
		
		<p>We’ve all “accidentally” inhaled a bag of chips like Kirby, which makes this simile effective at building Pargin’s argument because it is relatable.</p>
		
		<p class="essayheading">Bathos and Diction</p>
		
		<p>Pargin’s article is incredibly entertaining to read, and that is because he wisely uses the principle of “bathos” throughout, which is defined as “the sudden appearance of the commonplace in otherwise elevated matter or style.” Pargin takes steps back from speaking in neutral diction when sharing important information to suddenly making quick quips and casual conversation. He goes from speaking about the horrific implications of video games being Skinner Boxes to suddenly cracking jokes about anatomy and using crass slang. The reason this makes Pargin’s arguments stronger is because he knows how to effectively speak to his audience—gamers. We’re a bunch of reserved and immature idiots, and Pargin speaks our language. He knows how to draw our attention with a small quip, then provide the relevant and important information in neutral diction, and then keep us engaged and moving to the next paragraph with wild bathos. </p>
		
		<p>One of the best examples in the article is when Pargin begins explaining that the ultimate goal for game designers is to make the gamer want to call their Skinner Box their home. He opens with what may seem as a somewhat out-of-place line: “Do you like your job? Considering half of you are reading this at work, I'm going to guess no.” This is brilliant because by calling out his audience in this way, he is showing that he understands them. Acknowledging the reality of your audience increases how persuasive your arguments are.</p>
		
		<p class="essayheading">Conclusion</p>
		
		<p>I love video games. I love the sense of wonder and discovery of a good role-playing game; I love the sense of accomplishment of platformers and achievement hunting. I love the online communities created by fans of the same game, and I love sitting down with my friends to play party games. That being said, video game addiction is a real problem that negatively affects thousands of people around the world, and we need to be aware and cautious. Pargin’s article is a great resource for learning about video game addiction because of his persuasive arguments. It is entertaining, it is relatable, and he shares information from industry insiders who know how to get you addicted to video games. Overall, this article is a fascinating read that everyone interested in the ramifications of gaming as a hobby should read. </p>
