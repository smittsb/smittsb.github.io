		<p>One of the first signs of organized human civilization is Göbekli Tepe, located in southeast modern-day Turkey. The world’s oldest known megalithic structure, in which the buildings are supported by large columns, is an engineering marvel. Archeologists are uncovering buildings that display the human need for community and grain storage resulting in the earliest known major construction undertaking of unprecedented scale. As civilization has advanced, so has its needs, resulting in demand for more complex structures. The art of designing and building structures has passed through generations of technological evolution as the needs of humanity have changed. Many currently tend to think of the structural design process as architects sitting at slanted tables, carefully measuring out and sketching lines on large sheets of paper. Computer aided design (CAD) applications, essentially an automated version of hand-drafting, are more efficient and precise, but when visualizing construction projects virtual paper has the same limitations as real paper. In recent years the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry has determined that these methods of drafting do not meet the pace and precision required by the increasingly automated and fast-paced world. They need to be able to fully visualize the project in three dimensions during design. They need to understand the properties of each material used in construction. This demand has led to the creation of a new design technology and process that 3D modeling can address by incorporating data of the relevant materials in the computer files. This advance is known as Building Information Modeling, and it is being adopted across the AEC industry in a technological shift, but what is it and why is it such a significant technological leap?</p>
		
		<p>Building Information Modeling (BIM) is an extremely broad and complex concept that has been given many different definitions based on the personal industry experience of industry members, but as defined by S. Kubba, an architect and AEC expert who has written multiple books about the industry,</p>
		
		<p class="essayblockquote">BIM technology allows an accurate virtual model of a building to be constructed digitally. Completed computer-generated models contain accurate and well-defined geometry and pertinent data required to facilitate the construction, fabrication, and procurement activities necessary to realize the final building. (Kubba, 2016)</p>
		
		<p>This encompasses the core mission of BIM: building the structure virtually before building it physically.</p>
		
		<p>To fully understand and appreciate this technology, a basic understanding of previous modern design methods is needed. Historically, drafters have used carefully established rules and methods to draw building schematics on paper (Johnson, 2005). Over time newer tools and mathematic disciplines increased the level of complexity and precision that was achievable through hand drafting, but precision was still limited by the human eye and width of the pencil lead. In the 1960’s the earliest forms of CAD became available to the commercial market. CAD works by plotting individual points in virtual space that define the constraints of lines, curves, and other shapes (see Figure 1). Because mathematical calculations can be infinitely precise with computers, these points (and therefore lines) can be as well. This allows designers to create even more complex drawings with even greater precision, reducing the likelihood of issues occurring during the physical construction process, such as material not being cut to the right length due to a mistake when writing down the measurements of a part or wall. CAD has a few other major advantages over hand drafting, such as a faster workflow, virtual layering tools to easily compare multiple drawings laid on top of one another, and the ability to easily find a measurement between two points or angles from anywhere in the drawings in an instant.</p>
		
		<p>BIM software works on the same basic principles, and to an outsider the tools appear virtually the same. However, there are significant key differences between the two types of software. While CAD is a computerized version of traditional hand drafting, BIM contains several other features can that expedite the design and construction process, and that can potentially solve construction problems before the first holes are dug on the jobsite. First, a comparison of the capabilities of two software packages, AutoCAD and Revit (an industry standard BIM software), both created by Autodesk (although these capabilities apply in similar ways to all other CAD and BIM software). AutoCAD functions primarily in a two-dimensional space, in which individual lines are drawn one at a time to create walls. Revit can draw an entire wall with each of its its material components, such as wall studs and plywood, all at once in the software’s 2D space (already making it significantly more efficient than AutoCAD), but Revit is not actually “drawing” a wall. What Revit is in essence doing is creating an entire 3D model of a wall, and then creating a 2D representation of the wall in the floor plan view by slicing it in a section at a set height (see Figure 2). So, while CAD is a process of creating sketches that represent a building’s layout, BIM is creating a 3D model of the entire building, and then pulling 2D representations from that model to show its layout. This model allows the designer to see the entire structure at once and make edits to it that automatically update all other views of the model (see Figure 3). In addition to this efficient tool, BIM allows the storage of metadata attached to every single object. This can be used to show the properties of the materials that make up an object, such as showing the individual layers of materials that make up the walls of homes. It can also be used to estimate materials, by calculating material quantities based on the model, or even run simulations on the physical properties of the modeled structure. </p>
		
		<p>Another incredible feature of BIM is the ability to create realistic 3D renderings of the project. These renderings can be used to sell a design to an owner or showcase the artistic abilities of the architect or virtual design & construction (VDC) engineer (see Figures 4 and 5). Renderings help the potential owner understand what exactly they are buying. While most people can read a floor plan and understand the general layout of a space, it is difficult for even industry professionals to visualize exactly what a kitchen is going to look like, unless a 3D model has been created and rendered. Another advantage of these renders is how easily materials and object textures can be changed, so that multiple variations of a room can be shown from which an owner can select their preferred options. By having these tools and conversations during the design process, money and time are saved during construction because virtually all aesthetic elements have been decided on before the foundation has been poured.</p>
		
		<p>One key aspect of BIM is the detailed level of planning that can be accomplished through its usage. Currently, few individuals possess the skillset required to complete a detailed plan for project execution without BIM (Aredah, et al., 2021). While it takes specialized training in specific disciplines to be able to compile only a section of planning in traditional methods (such as estimating materials, labor, and time through written equations), BIM can simplify this process and make it accessible to any engineer working on the project. This can be done through specialized model coordination, most significantly in clash detection. This is where VDC engineers working for general contractors and subcontractors use BIM software to simulate how various building systems are run throughout the structure, including electrical conduits, pipes for plumbing, and ducting for ventilation systems. All of the systems are color-coded in the software for easy identification (see Figure 6). The initial models are typically created by individual subcontractors that specialize in specific trades, such as those previously indicated. They are then compiled by the general contractor to be run through clash detection, which indicates and can notify the engineer where modeled systems conflict with each other. This process allows the general contractor and subcontractors to see where issues will occur and adjust the design and plan so that the construction process will progress more efficiently, saving time and money for the owner. </p>
		
		<p>In addition to simulated clash detection, BIM can also perform various types of other simulations on the physical properties of buildings, their systems, and their materials. BIM can show how air flows through a building depending on what systems are active, how water flows through pipes, or even the transfer of thermal energy through glass (We & Chen, 2021). These simulations again help to resolve construction issues before they occur. By repeatedly building structures virtually and testing every element of them thoroughly before building them physically, contractors can complete projects the right way the first time. This saves time, materials, labor, and overall cost to the owner. Contractors who employ these technologies also gain the potential added benefit of increased profit margins through the efficiency virtual construction brings to a project.</p>
		
		<p>BIM has many other benefits that the scope of this paper cannot cover in depth, such as augmented reality applications on job sites, specialized room design in virtual reality, and laser scanning jobsites. With all of these incredible capabilities, the question is raised of whether anyone would oppose the use of this technology. However, as with all technologies used in industrial practices, risks must be considered. The paper “Exploring the influence of risk in BIM implementation” states “apart from [researches] related to deadlines, budget and deliverables compliance, there are few studies associated to risks and success and success factors with BIM” (Silva, et al., 2021). One major risk is the cost tacked onto BIM software. While software packages like AutoCAD cost $1,775 for each license per year, Revit costs $2,545 per license (information obtained from Autodesk’s website as of February 8, 2022). If an office needed 30 individuals with individual licenses for these products, Revit would cost $23,100 more than AutoCAD. If the company does not have an explicit need to merge over to BIM software, the cost may exceed the return on investment. Additionally, because many construction trades still utilize AutoCAD, the company would need to purchase licenses for both to work most effectively. The annual cost for software alone for this theoretical company is now $129,600. This does not factor in other software required to fully realize the capabilities of BIM. It is not just about design, it’s about coordination between various trades and companies to create the best product in the most efficient way. This increased financial burden may not be a risk worth taking to some companies.</p>
		
		<p>The world is continuing to increase in pace. People travel faster, communicate faster, and want their purchases delivered faster. Construction has lagged behind other industries in speed, relying on technologies that have existed since the beginning of the industrial revolution. But thanks to the efficiency of BIM, owners who have purchased the time and resources of architects, engineers, and contractors are able to receive the final product in record time. The information revolution is giving construction the opportunity to create structures never thought possible, at speeds never thought possible. From megaliths to skyscrapers to intricately modeled systems, construction is at the beginning of another technological revolution that will change the world through BIM.</p>
