		<p>We’ve all been there: awake way too late at night, doom-scrolling on Facebook, Twitter, or Reddit. We’ve been online for so long that every cat video has started to blend together, having sent too many TikTok’s to our friends. Then we see it: something political that enrages us so much that we just cannot stop ourselves from sharing it with the entire world. Do we know the full context? Doesn’t matter. We’re angry, and everyone else needs to know, too.</p>
		
		<p>In an increasingly online world—thanks in part to both the proliferation of smartphones and being forced by the COVID-19 pandemic—we are constantly at risk of falling for outrage on social media platforms that want nothing more than for us to share content that invokes rage. Social media platforms damage human sociology and politics by providing consequence-free information sharing, reinforcing confirmation bias, and by rewarding the creation of inflammatory content.</p>
	
		<p class="essayheading">Consequence-free Dissemination of Information of Varying Credibility</p>
	
		<p>As someone who has actively used social media for over a decade, it amazes me at how long it took for Facebook, the single largest platform, to implement fact-checking on shared content. Despite newer efforts to combat the spread of misinformation, including the implementation of third-party fact-checking organizations, historically there have not been any consequences for sharing wildly ludicrous claims online. In an article published in the Atlantic, titled “The Dark Psychology of Social Networks,” authors Jonathan Haidt and Tobias Rose-Stockwell share the history and consequences of different social media platforms implementing “share” features, including media outlets creating clickbait headlines. Haidt and Rose-Stockwell state, “[T]he beginning of ‘You won’t believe …’ articles and their ilk, paired with images tested and selected to make us click impulsively.” I would also add that headlines make us share impulsively; it wasn’t until recently that Facebook started issuing warnings to you for sharing links before you opened them.</p>
		
		<p>Unfortunately, many individuals simply do not care if the information they are sharing is credible or accurate. In the article “Humans Are Hardwired to Dismiss Facts that Don't Fit Their Worldview,” Adrian Bardon presents what should be a simple solution, paired with the sad reality: “Just present evidence of a strong expert consensus. This approach succeeds most of the time [. . .] But things don’t work that way when the scientific consensus presents a picture that threatens someone’s ideological worldview.” Unfortunately, people are keen to quickly share anything that outrages them.</p>
		
		<p class="essayheading">Reinforcing Confirmation Bias</p>
		
		<p>In a similar vein, because one is not required to critically analyze every article they read and every video they watch before sharing them, confirmation bias runs rampant on social media. One would hope that living in an age where one can easily look up anything would result in better critical thinkers, but Bardon states that “it turns out that one’s political, religious or ethnic identity quite effectively predicts one’s willingness to accept expertise on any given politicized issue.” Regardless of what factual information may exist, it is typically ignored in favor of taking points for the tribe. Of course, social media is not the only culprit at play. Haidt and Rose-Stockwell share:</p>
		
		<p class="essayblockquote">The media have been fomenting division since Madison’s time, and political scientists have traced a portion of today’s outrage culture to the rise of cable television and talk radio in the 1980s and ’90s. A multiplicity of forces are pushing America toward greater polarization.</p>
		
		<p>It would be just as ludicrous to only blame social media as it is to share obvious misinformation online, but unfortunately social media has enabled anyone with a Wi-Fi connection to share whatever they want, no matter how absurd.</p>
		
		<p class="essayheading">Rewarding Inflammatory Content</p>
		
		<p>But why do people create and share such absurd messages online? Unfortunately, it all comes back to social media platforms rewarding virality. Haidt and Rose-Stockwell share that “in 2009, [Facebook] added the ‘Like’ button, for the first time creating a public metric for the popularity of content.” They additionally explain that algorithms take note what content you “like,” and give you more of it. This popularity contest of “likes” leads to people creating outrageous content in an effort to win these fake Internet points, but unfortunately people believe the inflammatory things that are being shared. Individuals also use this as a way to judge how much their tribe has accepted them. Bardon explains, “Assimilation into one’s tribe required assimilation into the group’s ideological belief system. An instinctive bias in favor of one’s ‘in-group’ and its worldview is deeply ingrained in human psychology.” It is really easy to feel that you have been accepted into your ideological tribe when your posts are receiving dozens, or even millions, of “likes.”</p>
		
		<p class="essayheading">Conclusion</p>
		
		<p>Social media is never going to go away. New platforms keep popping up all the time, and with the increasing polarization of American politics, many of these platforms cater to specific political ideologies. And unfortunately, with the continued proliferation of users, these platforms are not going to change how they combat inflammatory content. It will still be rewarded, it will still be shared within factions to confirm their biases, and nobody will every truly be held accountable for sharing damaging content. All that we can do is become better informed for ourselves, and encourage others to learn how to think critically and personally hold individuals accountable for sharing ludicrous content online.</p>
