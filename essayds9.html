	<h1 class="essaytitle">Incorporating Star Trek: Deep Space Nine in the English 301 Curriculum</h1>
	
	<h4 class="published">Published on December 2, 2022</h4>
	
	<h4 class="noteonessay"> <p>A note about this essay:</p><p>This essay was composed as a researched argument for the Advanced Writing & Research (English 301) course at BYU–I. Per assignment parameters, the audience this essay was written for was the course professor, hence the references to both the professor and the advocacy for including the television show as a part of a class curriculum.</p></h4>
	
	<section class="essaybody">
	
		<p>Throughout recent history, several pieces of media have addressed contemporary political issues through the lens of fictional storytelling. One of the most prominent examples of this is the Star Trek franchise, which has been tackling political issues and moral dilemmas since 1966. Both the original Star Trek: The Original Series and Star Trek: The Next Generation have stayed more relevant in modern pop culture than other entries, but it is the third series, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (DS9), which ran from 1993–1999, that most openly discussed issues like racism, minority representation, and identity practices. Professor Stewart, you should incorporate portions of DS9 into the English 301 curriculum because it showcases representation of black fatherhood, addresses contemporary racism, and discusses gender identity and sexuality.</p>
	
		<p class="essayheading">Representation of Black Fathers</p>
	
		<p>One of the shared aspects between most Star Trek shows is an unmarried captain with no children. DS9 breaks out of this mold by introducing us to lead Benjamin Sisko (portrayed by Avery Brooks), a widower raising his son by himself. This difference from previous entries is further highlighted by Sisko being a black man. During the casting phase of the show, the showrunners were very careful to write characters that were not written for a specific race, allowing for more actors to have the opportunity to portray these characters. In an article that explores racism and representation in DS9, Lisa Doris Alexander explains why this made the casting of Brooks as Sisko so significant: </p>
		
		<p class="essayblockquote">While Sisko was not written as a black man, he was always written as a single father who was raising a son. In American culture, the image of white fatherhood is dramatically different from the image of black fatherhood. One of the controlling images in American culture that constrains black men is this notion of black men as negligent fathers. (2016)</p>
		
		<p>The inclusion of a strong black father who deeply loves and cares for his son and crew is important for all to see, and would be beneficial for students to understand how representation has a positive impact on our perception of marginalized groups.</p>
		
		<p class="essayheading">Contemporary Race Issues</p>
		
		<p>Star Trek has had its fair share of episodes throughout its history that discuss racism, but none were as blatant at calling out racism in our society as DS9’s “Past Tense,” which aired in 1995. This episode featured the station crew being transported back in time to the year 2024, right in the middle of a brewing revolution in San Franciso. In an article published in The Atlantic, writer Robert Greene II describes the different approach this episode took that made it much more impactful: “It dispensed with clumsy metaphors to examine public health and mental illness [. . .] The script was also written and produced only two years after the Los Angeles Riots, which clearly influenced the story” (2017). These are complex issues to discuss, and at the time were especially difficult with the recent memory of the tragedies in LA—but the episode does an excellent job of addressing them in a way that any viewer can understand.</p>
		
		<p>But what makes this even more important for the English 301 curriculum is who is telling the story of these issues of racism. Greene continues, “‘Past Tense’ was notable for depicting racism not from the perspective of a well-meaning white liberal, as seen in previous iterations of Star Trek, but through the eyes of people of color directly threatened by violence and indifference” (2017). Our campus is not particularly diverse, so even on topics related to anti-racism nearly all voices are white. Students being exposed to depictions of racism from the perspective of marginalized groups will help them to better understand how to recognize and discuss racism.</p>
		
		<p>One additional example of addressing racism is DS9’s “Far Beyond the Stars,” which takes place in a hallucination depicting a black author in 1950’s New York City. This episode openly shows the struggles of black authors trying to get their work published and being credited for their work. One of the characters, Jimmy, in response to being told that things may be different in a century, says, “Well, I've got news for you. Today or a hundred years from now, it don't make a bit of difference. As far as they're concerned, we'll always be [n-----]” (Zicree & Brooks, 1995). This forces the viewer to give pause and consider how they view historically marginalized groups, and it would be invaluable in the course.</p>
		
		<p class="essayheading">Gender Identity and Sexuality</p>
		
		<p>In its long-running history of advocacy, Star Trek has also addressed issues relating to gender identity and sexuality. DS9 breaks new ground by fleshing out information about an in-universe species, the Trill, a metaphor for gender identity and sexuality, by including a member of the species (Jadzia Dax, later Ezri Dax) in the main cast. Trill are humanoid, but some are privileged with the responsibility of carrying a “symbiote” in their body (Dax, in this case), which has its own personality and contains all of the experiences and memories of its past hosts. Symbiotes can be hosted in both male and female Trill, and writer Kathy Ferguson composed an analytical paper in which she discusses why this works so well as a metaphor for sexuality and gender issues. In her paper she discusses how the character Dax is able to maintain friendships from past lives, even if characters need to get to know the new them. This leads to encounters with the female spouse of Dax’s past male host and a discussion of sexuality, and when Dax is transferred into a new host, Ezri, later in the show, characters have to learn who Ezri is as they let go of Jadzia (2002). Many students at BYU–I have not had much exposure to the LGBTQIA+ community in their personal lives, and it would be beneficial for them to see analogies for sexuality and gender identity in ways that are alien, yet somehow easier for some to comprehend.</p>
		
		<p class="essayheading">Conclusion</p>
		
		<p>I am biased, because DS9 is one of my favorite television series of all time and I would encourage anyone to watch it for its mystery, intrigue, and moral dilemmas. But there is so much that one can gain from the show by learning about how it addresses complex issues of politics and marginalized communities. The analogies for sexuality, gender identity, and racism are poignant and cause the viewer to truly think about these issues. DS9 deserves a place in the English 301 curriculum and in the minds of the students who take the course.</p>
