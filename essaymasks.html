		<p>Did you know that a third of COVID-19 cases result in brain damage? Without preventative efforts to avoid infection, individuals with mild cases of the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can have symptoms of brain shrinkage that reduce the amount of gray matter in affected brains. Oxford University found that this shrinkage damages areas of the brain related to emotion, memory, and sense of smell (Douaud, et al, 2022). COVID-19 symptoms can also last long after the typical infection period in around 10% of individuals, including “persist[ant] . . . fatigue, breathlessness, chest pain, and body aches” (Jones, et al., 2021). Globally, 6.1 million individuals have died from this respiratory disease (World Health Organization, n.d.). In 2020, the COVID-19 death rate was 1.85% in the United States (Alsan, et al., 2021), which scales to 146 million deaths if no preventative efforts to reduce the spread were taken and everyone in the entire world were infected; 20 million more deaths than both world wars combined. In addition to these physical effects, economies have been devastated, communities separated, and lives forever changed. But none of this ever had to happen. The spread of respiratory illnesses can be controlled through conscious efforts of the affected population. Historically, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, preventative methods to reduce transmission of airborne illnesses through the use of face coverings have proven to be effective, by reducing the number of respiratory droplets and aerosols that are ejected into the air by those wearing face coverings and reducing the amount of foreign respiratory droplets and aerosols inhaled by those wearing face coverings.</p>
		
		<p>Despite contemporary widespread political debates surrounding the legality and morality of mask mandates, or the efficacy of widespread use of face coverings; their use to prevent the spread of disease is not a new practice. During the influenza pandemic of 1918, commonly referred to as the Spanish Flu, mask mandates were implemented throughout the United States to prevent the spread of the virus. Noncompliance could result in individuals not being allowed entry into public places (Rizzo, n.d.). In Japan, face masks have been commonly used for 170 years. Originally used by coal miners to reduce the amount of dust they inhaled, they were adopted by the general public to prevent the spread of illnesses, such as influenza. Masks became a normal part of life, with many wearing them during flu seasons, and some wearing them when they are sick (Anyiam-Osigwe, 2021). These masks have been effective at reducing the spread of illnesses throughout the country, and during the COVID-19 pandemic have reduced the number of deaths.</p>
		
		<p>Unfortunately, during this crisis the nature of the pandemic and both the need for preventative measures and their effectiveness have been greatly downplayed by some, leading to widespread misinformation about the severity of virality and effects of the disease. Many believed the disease to be harmless and nothing to worry about, but countless hospitals and healthcare facilities across the world have witnessed the ugly horrors of the pandemic. One healthcare facility in India that specializes in infant delivery shared their experiences in the International Journal of Reproduction, Contraception, Obstetrics and Gynecology. Unfortunately, 18.4% of their COVID-19 positive patients required a ventilator in an ICU, and 7.6% of the mothers infected with the disease died (Chavan, et al., 2022).</p>
		
		<p>Face masks have become a political issue in many places due to mandates created by local and national governments to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The effects of COVID-19 were still largely unknown when the disease first began to spread across the world, and caution and prevention through the implementation of mask mandates was chosen to keep the general population healthy while the effects of the disease were studied, and vaccinations developed to provide immunity. Misinformation about both respiratory illnesses and face masks spread with a greater virality than the disease, with questions arising if masks could even stop a virus measured in nanometers from being inhaled by an uninfected person. Thankfully, the viruses and bacteria that cause respiratory illnesses travel in the droplets that we exhale, which are much larger than the infectious cells and can be stopped by face coverings worn by the infected individual (Dbouk, Drikakis, 2020). One ambitious filmmaker created a demonstration to display these mechanics. After twenty minutes of trying to force himself to sneeze, cinematographer Gavin Free, who specializes in capturing the world in slow-motion, was finally able to let loose a big one right in front of a camera filming at a rate of one thousand frames per second. This sneeze, filmed 40 times slower than real life, shows an unbridled stampede of saliva and mucus escaping from his mouth and nose into the surrounding air. While reviewing the footage for the first time, Free remarks that he wishes he could “unsee” it. Free had also previously demonstrated the significantly smaller number of respiratory droplets that are expelled into the air when wearing a cloth mask earlier in his video, barely a shudder of mist and dust coming a few millimeters off of his mask (The Slow Mo Guys, 2020). While graphs and other statistical data contain information vital to understanding the impact of respiratory illnesses, simple demonstrations like Free’s can help individuals understand their personal impact on their environments and those around them. Covering our mouths and noses when we sneeze or cough greatly reduces the amount of harmful viruses and bacteria that we expose others to, keeping everyone healthier.</p>
		
		<p>Despite historical evidence of mandates being effective and common, two questions commonly arise surrounding the efficacy of face masks: whether they stop the contagious respiratory particles at the source through infected individuals wearing masks, and whether they protect uninfected wearers from others. To address the first question, numerous studies have been conducted by universities and healthcare agencies during the COVID-19 pandemic to find out if transmission of this disease can be prevented by the infected wearing face coverings. A study by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control and the University of Hong Kong in which individuals infected with coronavirus, influenza, and/or rhinovirus had their respiratory aerosols tested for those viruses, found that face coverings worn by symptomatic individuals resulted in a “trend toward reduced detection of coronavirus RNA in respiratory droplets”. Within the sample for this study, it was found that “coronavirus [was detected] in respiratory droplets and aerosols in 3 of 10 (30%) . . . of the samples collected without face masks”. Additionally, zero of the participants who had tested positive for COVID-19 that were selected to wear face masks had respiratory droplets and aerosols test positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Leung, et al., 2020).</p>
		
		<p>While face masks can help prevent the spread of illness to others by “catching” these droplets, do face masks protect the uninfected from breathing in contagious particles? Filtration capabilities of face masks at keeping out unwanted particles is a major consideration to make when choosing what type of face mask to wear, and multiple studies have been performed to determine what the most efficacious options are. Researchers writing for the American Chemical Society that specialize in observing the world at an atomic scale found that the homemade cloth masks most commonly worn during the COVID-19 pandemic are capable of filtering between 5-25% of foreign particulates, depending on the material type and density of the weave (Zhao, et al., 2020). An even more comprehensive study performed at the University of Hawaii that also included various types of medical masks, medical respirators, and face shields found that while face shields still allow for a significant amount of respiratory aerosols and droplets to both enter and escape around the open sides of the plastic, medical masks can typically filter out between 19-33% of foreign particulates, while an N95 respirator is required to filter out 95% of particulates (Ju, et al., 2021). While not all are equal in efficacy, these masks still provide some level of protection from respiratory illnesses. When both infected and uninfected individuals wear face masks, the risk of further spread of the disease is reduced by an order of magnitude, saving lives.</p>
		
		<p>Real-world studies during the COVID-19 pandemic have also shown the significant reduction in rates of the disease in areas where the majority of the population wore face coverings. The Boston University School of Public Health collected “data on mask wearing and physical distance policies, mask adherence, COVID-19 cases, and demographics . . . from publicly available sources” to determine if mask mandates, and compliance to them, were effective at reducing the spread of the disease. The graph in Figure 2, from their study, indicates that states with higher levels of mask compliance between June and October of 2020 had lower rates of  COVID-19 than states with lower mask usage. In fact, they found that states with over 75% mask usage and compliance had the lowest rates of COVID-19 during the sample period of April to October of 2020 (Fischer, et al., 2021). </p>
		
		<p>Making the decision to wear a face mask when sick has positive impact beyond anything the individual can observe. Even a simple cold, if not contained, could transmit across several people and lead to further complications resulting in death for an immunocompromised individual. While other preventative measures exist as well, such as vaccines to build immunity within the population, these are not 100% effective and require continual booster doses as long as the disease is still spreading among the unvaccinated population, further mutating into iterations that have developed their own immunities against the antibodies created in individuals by a vaccine or prior infection. By stopping the spread of these diseases at the source, the widespread negative impact across the affected population is greatly reduced. Whether a small rhinovirus or influenza outbreak in a school, or a global pandemic caused by influenza, coronavirus, or other dangerous viruses and bacteria, wearing masks grounds the disease, preventing it from taking off and spreading. Millions of lives can be saved if everyone properly wears masks during future respiratory pandemics, untold numbers of people will not suffer brain damage or other debilitating long-term effects of the illness, and pandemics will end much quicker. Conscientious efforts to make the decision to reduce the spread of any illness you may have by wearing a face mask will have a far-reaching impact, and encouraging others to be considerate of others’ health by wearing face masks when sick will help the world to become a safer and healthier place. Making this decision, and encouraging others through example, may just save your life one day.</p>
