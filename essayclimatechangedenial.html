	<section class="essaybody">
	
		<p>One of the most hotly debated issues in American and global politics is climate change. Debates about the current status and long-term ramifications of climate change are completely valid, as the combined efforts of various scientific bodies and disciplines continuously acquire data and distill trends from it. There are debates of what the best ways to respond to climate change are, what methods will be the most effective at the lowest cost. But in addition to these academic and economic debates, a much more vocal and divided discourse is present: the debate of whether or not climate change is real. It is difficult to parse out why exactly the existence of climate change is so widely debated, but David Brin, science fiction author and physicist, has authored the article “A War on Expertise: The Real Struggle Behind Climate Change Denial,” which analyzes the deeper core arguments of the debate. Stepping back from discussing debates within the research community of hard science, Brin composes a convincing paper that analyzes both historical philosophical debates, contemporary political arguments, and states that climate change denial would not be an issue if individuals were environmentally responsible for the sake of benefitting their own lives.</p>
	
		<p class="essayheading">Historical Debates</p>
	
		<p>Brin provides historical context that helps the audience to understand why debates like this exist in the first place, when the jury has already issued a verdict. He cites what is known as the “Boffin Principle,” in which British citizens and politicians consider experts of specific fields unfit to propose legislature. The concern centers around whether or not individuals who are “intellectuals” would focus on their own agendas more than the will of the people. He references the 19th century Know Nothing Party, which “[was] deliberately stoked by aristocracies who saw the new, mental elites as a threat.” Understanding this historical example helps us understand why individuals who do not understand the scientific methods and processes would have this amount of distrust in those who purport to be arbiters of truth.</p>
		
		<p>Antithetical to the Boffin Principle was the “Technocracy Movement,” which occurred during the 1930’s. Defined by Brin as a philosophy that “held that knowledge and skill should be paramount criteria for positions of leadership,” one can understand why this movement gained some level of popularity. Brin does not thoroughly explain why he views this movement to be almost as concerning as the Know Nothings, but one can parse out that there are dangers when a pendulum swings too far to either side.</p>
		
		<p class="essayheading">Contemporary Debates and Politics</p>
		
		<p>By utilizing information from history to understand why these debates exist today, Brin indicates that climate change deniers have a strong distrust of intellectuals and scientists who study this crisis. Stating that those throughout the denial movement assert that 99% of climate scientists and bodies have been corrupted by their own agendas, we see somewhat of a parallel to the Boffin Principle, with those who do not have the training to conduct scientific research believing that anyone telling them to live differently for the benefit of the environment and world must have an agenda. Brin uses forceful language to drive his point home, stating that “at all levels of the War on Science . . . [climate change deniers believe that] since almost all top atmospheric scientists accept human-propelled climate change, [scientists] must be all cretins, corrupt, or cowards.” He continues on to state that if one believes that these groups and individuals are universally corrupt, then they will also believe that anyone who agrees with the science must be a sellout. I understand why this belief is commonplace. Because we love confirmation bias, if we believe that someone has a corrupt agenda, then we can easily believe that anyone who agrees with what they are saying has been paid off in some way by the supposedly corrupt body.</p>
		
		<p>Brin points out that sometimes the field of science has caused some of the distrust against it. Quoting Michael Crichton, who said “there is no such thing as scientific consensus,” it is easy to understand why distrust against science exists. When a popular author makes a claim that can easily be turned into a soundbite, why wouldn’t people latch onto it as a core part of their identity politics? Brin states that he has had his own personal issues with the scientific community at various times, but points out that “empowered citizenship should supplement, not replace, the people who actually know the most about a topic.” While all of Brin’s article presents a very convincing argument as to why the denial movement exists, this is a very convincing argument for why the movement should not exist in the first place.</p>

		<p class="essayheading">Climate Intervention Benefits Humanity in Other Ways</p>
		
		<p>Brin states that he personally would not have any issue with people who deny climate change as long as those individuals would strive to implement common-sense practices that would benefit humanity and the climate as a byproduct. Creating a hypothetical climate change denier, he states he would have no issue with the denier if they would advocate for things like decreased reliance on foreign fossil fuels, decreased pollution, and support fiscally responsible energy solutions. He states that he has met some conservatives who believe in those principles while denying climate change, and I am inclined to agree with his beliefs that conversations with those individuals “[deserve] eye-to-eye answers.” This entire section of his article is convincing because it acknowledges that it is okay for people to have different beliefs, as long as they are willing to have intellectual discussion.</p>
		
		<p class="essayheading">Conclusion</p>
		
		<p>Brin’s article is convincing because it uses historical information, acknowledges valid debates, and provides examples of how climate intervention would benefit all even if climate change were not a problem. Very few people are inclined to listen to a speaker who criticizes what they stand for, unless the speaker acknowledges known issues. Brin acknowledges shortcomings in the scientific community, and he advocates for intellectual discussion. In his words, “Respect toward professionals is compatible with keeping an eye on them.” We can trust research and academia while holding them accountable. We can discuss climate change without starting fights. We can find solutions to the world’s problems as long as we are willing to understand the history behind similar movements and work together to find universally beneficial solutions.</p>
