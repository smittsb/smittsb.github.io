		<p>I have always had a passison for designing and building things, finding meaning in getting my hands dirty as I try to make art or solve problems. My journey towards studying Virtual Design & Construction is nothing but short of a miracle and I have come to discover that it is my calling in life. I took a chance on choosing my major, and as it has changed my life I have strived to continue to give back to fellow students in my program and to put forth my best effort for my employers.</p>
		<p>Another important passion of mine is writing. I had a fantastic professor for my first collegiate writing course who helped me discover my love for research and communication. She encouraged me to pursue a minor in English, and two semesters later the Department of English announced that it would be creating a new Technical & Professional Writing minor. This was the perfect way for me to blend my love of VDC with my love of writing, better preparing myself to effectively communicate within the construction industry.</p>
